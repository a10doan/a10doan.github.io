## Unit 16 | Assignment - D3 Analysis (CDC/Census)

Skills Tested: JavaScript, D3.js (library), HTML/CSS Visualization, Search/filter data, critical data analysis, correlation analysis.


This assignment applies JavaScript along with the D3.js library to present and visualize data collected from the census beureau and CDC.  First, data was collected from the CDC, topics were filtered using the question/topic filters.  The first topic chosen was overall health opinion, and then a search was conducted using the census beureau data, where poverty levels were chosen.  Data was cleaned using excel and a correlation calculation yielded a correlation coefficient of .90.  Two explainations for this can be people's perception of overall health can be affected by socioeconomic factors.  Simply speaking, a person's well-being is determined by economic status.  On the other hand, a person's poverty status is the result of health, which is also plausible because an unhealthy person cannot be gainfully employed.

The data was also accompanied by other data, as to show the transition effects within D3, and to add a user interface.  Tooltips was applied to add hovering details of X and Y axis data.
